            <h1>About HappyHemp</h1>
            <p>Happy Hemp has spent the last two months buying rug coin after rug coin.
                He was extremely depressed in the process wondering what he was doing wrong. 
                After hiding away in his basement for days smoking lots of cannabis a light bulb went off in his head..
                Why not create a communnity based coin where everyone succeeds? Why does only one person get to make money and live happily ever after?
                The journey starts..Happy spent months doing research on how to effectivly create a community based meme coin.
                After days and days of research he was ready to launch with one goal in mind..
                Create a strong and safe community to share new ideas & take his coin to the moon..
                Being able to put all the rug pulls in the past to rest.                
                </p>
